# Looker Dashboard Migration Tool - Master Plan

## Overview
A web-based tool that simplifies the process of migrating Looker dashboards between explores. The tool allows users to select dashboards, map fields between explores, and execute migrations with safety measures in place.

## Target Audience
- Looker developers
- Data analysts
- BI team members managing Looker instances

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Security
- Direct Looker API credential input
- Secure credential handling (no storage)
- Session-based user management

### 2. Dashboard Management
- Dashboard selection interface
- Explore field fetching and display
- Field mapping creation through web form
- Temporary dashboard creation for validation

### 3. Migration Process
- Field mapping validation
- Temporary dashboard creation
- Migration execution
- Detailed logging system

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Vue.js)
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vue Router for multi-step navigation
- Vuex for state management
- Component structure:
  - Authentication
  - Dashboard Selection
  - Field Mapping
  - Migration Execution
  - Log Display

### Backend (Python)
- FastAPI for REST endpoints
- Looker SDK integration
- Async operations handling
- Error management system

### Security Considerations
- No credential storage
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

## Data Flow
1. User inputs Looker credentials
2. Application fetches available dashboards
3. User selects dashboards for migration
4. Application fetches fields from source/destination explores
5. User creates field mappings
6. System creates temporary dashboard copies
7. User reviews and confirms
8. System executes migration
9. Logs are generated and displayed

- Error rate monitoring

## Development Timeline
- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week

Total estimated timeline: 8 weeks for initial release
